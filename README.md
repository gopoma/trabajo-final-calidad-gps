## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install all the dependencies of the project by using:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source ./venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It is then sufficient to navigate to the src directory and execute the program using the following command:

```bash
python gvfc.py
```
